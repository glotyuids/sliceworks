# Handoff <allocation>

<!-- sliceworks 0.6.0. Committed by the worker on its branch before it returns (method chapter 19). The CANDIDATE, BLOCKED or HOLD message is a pointer to this file; this file is the record. -->

## Completed scope
<rows flipped, files changed in one line each>

## Verification
<what ran, from which commit, with which boundary (compile-only, executed, runtime); the RESULT line; what was NOT_RUN and why>

## Failures, classified
<!-- against the allocation's baseline: a failure is introduced (absent on the base), inherited (present on the base; still blocks a mandatory gate, assigned, never waived), setup (NOT_RUN, the workload never started; the known remedy), or unproven (cause not established; stays red) -->
| check | class (introduced, inherited, setup, unproven) | evidence | assigned to |

## Findings decided out of scope
<id: reason>

## Blockers
<what stops the next step; the default the worker would apply>

## Next bounded action believed authorized
<one sentence, or "none">

## Stop gate output
<what the T0 gate printed on the last turn, verbatim first line>
